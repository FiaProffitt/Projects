# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Lunar Lander 

## Project Overview

The project focuses on implementing a **deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent** to solve the **Lunar Lander** environment from OpenAI Gym (now Gymnasium). The goal is to demonstrate the agent's learning progress and performance in navigating the lunar surface.

## Problem Addressed

### Problem: Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Lunar Lander (80 marks)
* **Task:** Implement a deep reinforcement learning agent.
* **Environment:** Utilize the **`lunar_lander`** environment from Gymnasium (refer to the [Lunar Lander documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) for details).
* **Learning Progress Visualization:** Plot the agent's learning progress over **0 to 1000 episodes**. This should include:
    * A figure showing **rewards** per episode.
    * A figure showing **training loss** over time.
* **Agent Demonstration:** Provide a demonstration of the trained agent's performance using **video, GIFs, or figures**.

## Project Structure

* **Source Code:** Contains the implementation of the deep reinforcement learning agent (e.g., DRL algorithm, environment interaction, training loop, visualization code), likely in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script format.
* **Plots/Figures:** Images showing the reward and loss curves over training episodes.
* **Demonstration:** Video, GIFs, or image sequences showcasing the agent's performance in the `lunar_lander` environment.

# Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning 

## Project Overview

The project centers on **multi-armed bandit problems** in Reinforcement Learning, focusing on the fundamental concepts of **exploration and exploitation**. The main goal is to implement and analyze a multi-armed bandit algorithm, along with providing clear explanations of key concepts for an academic report.

## Problem: Multi-Armed Bandit Implementation
* **Task:** Implement a **multi-armed bandit algorithm**.
* **Context:** Based on figures and concepts from Sutton & Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (Chapter 2, multi-armed bandits, as referenced in the provided URL).
* **Specifics:** Develop a solution for an **n-armed bandit** where `n` can be **5, 10, or 20**. The total number of plays should be **2000**. The solution must explicitly consider the balance between **exploration and exploitation**.
* **Deliverables:** Source code (e.g., an IPython Notebook file) and a brief report discussing the solution, results, and analysis.
